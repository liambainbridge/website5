        I've been weightlifting for 12 years now and over those years I've learned a lot, mostly through trial and error. I've read countless articles online, read scores of books and watched hundreds, if not, thousands of hours of content online to try and get the best out of my training. I even became a qualified fitness instructor and a personal trainer.

        In today's world full of influencers and big companies, weight lifting has become very popular. However, with the vast information out there, it can be overwhelming to find out where to begin or where to go next. I've been there myself and I know how frustrating it can be to spend weeks or sometimes even months of your lifting career trying out something that promised you certain results, only to be let down in the end.

        So, my aim is to clear the air about weightlifting and bring it back down to the basics. If you want to really get into the complicated stuff, I will post a few links down below to a few youtube channels that I firmly believe will help you to understand the more complex side of training.

        Before you head to youtube, here's a touch of advice; remember that infuencers are on the web for <b>entertainment</b> purposes. Chances are, you would learn more watching one of Dr Mikes 1-hour lectures, than if you were to watch 10 hours of infuencer content.

        Apparently, bald dudes make the best content.
